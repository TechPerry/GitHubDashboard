# GitHub Dashboard powered by Blazor

This is a demo application built with Blazor. For now it is using the server side hosting model. Its main purpose is to talk to the GitHub Api, 
get some valueable information and display it in the browser. An ultimate goal is to continue to grow this application trying to not write a single line of Javascript.
